Here's what to do instead:\n\nFor create/update operations:\n```\n✓ Shop added\n```\nor just show the new item appearing with a subtle highlight/fade animation\n\nFor deletes:\nShow temporary undo toast:\n```\nShop deleted  •  Undo\n```\n\nWhy this approach:\n- Success messages for routine actions create unnecessary noise\n- Users expect immediate feedback through visual changes\n- Animations provide confirmation without interrupting flow\n- Undo options are more valuable than success confirmations\n- Modern UIs prioritize minimal, unobtrusive feedback\n\nException cases where success messages make sense:\n- Complex processes (file uploads, multi-step operations)\n- Actions where results aren't immediately visible\n- Critical business operations needing explicit confirmation\n- When legal/compliance requires confirmation\n\nCurrent practices from major platforms:\n- Gmail: Shows checkmark for sent mail\n- GitHub: Silent success with visual state changes\n- Slack: Animates new messages appearing\n- Twitter: Shows temporary confirmation for tweets\n\nSources:\n- Material Design Guidelines \n- Apple Human Interface Guidelines\n- Nielsen Norman Group on Form Design\n- Shopify Polaris Design System\nso for that i think message will be displayed in the fronted side if needed and the backend will just return a data\n\nExactly right. Backend should:\n\n```typescript\n// Instead of this\nreturn { message: \"Shop created successfully\" }\n\n// Do this\nreturn {\n  id: newShop.id,\n  name: newShop.name,\n  // ... other shop data\n}\n```\n\nFrontend decides how to handle success:\n```typescript\nconst createShop = async (data) => {\n  const shop = await api.createShop(data)\n  \n  // Add to state/store\n  shops.value.push(shop)\n  \n  // Optional subtle feedback\n  toast.success('✓ Shop added')\n  // or\n  highlightNewItem(shop.id)\n}\n```\n\nThis approach:\n- Keeps concerns separated\n- Gives frontend flexibility for different UX treatments\n- Returns actual data that might be needed\n- Follows REST/GraphQL best practices\n- Makes testing cleaner on both ends\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":322}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":154},"start":1593,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":323}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":155},"start":2837,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":324}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":299},"start":2954,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":325}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":300},"start":3672,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":326}}}],"summary":"Modern Success Message UX Design","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null}]}
