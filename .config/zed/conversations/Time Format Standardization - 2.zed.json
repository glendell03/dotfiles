This is the standard convention in most time systems.\n\nIf you're working with time formatting in code, here's how to represent midnight in common languages:\n\n```javascript\n// JavaScript\nconst midnight = new Date();\nmidnight.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);\nconsole.log(midnight.toLocaleTimeString('en-US')); // \"12:00:00 AM\"\n\n// For just hours and minutes\nconsole.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {\n  hour: '2-digit', \n  minute: '2-digit', \n  hour12: true\n}).format(midnight)); // \"12:00 AM\"\n```\n\n```python\n# Python\nfrom datetime import time\nimport time as time_module\nmidnight = time(0, 0)\nprint(midnight.strftime(\"%I:%M %p\"))  # \"12:00 AM\"\n```\n```tsx dance-book-app/src/components/calendar/index.tsx:27-28\n// Excerpt from: \nexport const earliestTime = 540;\nexport const latestTime = 1320;\n```\nplease check this\n\nThose values represent time in minutes since midnight.\n\n- `earliestTime = 540` = 9:00 AM (540 ÷ 60 = 9 hours after midnight)\n- `latestTime = 1320` = 10:00 PM (1320 ÷ 60 = 22 hours after midnight)\n\nIf you want to set the latest time to midnight (12:00 AM), you should change it to:\n\n```tsx\nexport const earliestTime = 540;\nexport const latestTime = 1440; // 24 hours × 60 minutes = 1440 minutes (midnight)\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want the latest time to be 11:59 PM (one minute before midnight):\n\n```tsx\nexport const earliestTime = 540;\nexport const latestTime = 1439; // 23 hours and 59 minutes\n```\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":124}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":24},"start":1310,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":125}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":2045,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":126}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":65},"start":2213,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":127}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":66},"start":2818,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":128}}}],"summary":"Time Format Standardization","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":2045,"end":2193},"icon":"TextSnippet","label":"dance-book-app/src/components/calendar/index.tsx, Lines 27 to 28","metadata":null}]}
