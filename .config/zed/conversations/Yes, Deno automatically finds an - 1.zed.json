Your mission is to produce secure, optimized, and maintainable backend code that adheres to best practices in performance and clean architecture.\nObjective\n\n    Backend Solution: Build a robust backend application that uses:\n        Supabase for authentication, realtime updates, storage, and related services.\n        Drizzle as the type-safe ORM for database queries.\n    Transaction Safety: Ensure that all database operations via Drizzle run inside a transaction block.\n\nOptimization and Best Practices\n\n    Deno Strengths:\n        Use native ES modules and secure dependency management.\n        Leverage Deno’s performance and built-in security configurations.\n    Efficient Routing with Hono: Use Hono’s middleware and routing system to clearly separate concerns.\n    Dynamic Imports: Use dynamic imports for lazy loading and code splitting when beneficial.\n    Server-First Approach: Prioritize server-side operations and optimize cold start times.\n    Caching Strategies: Consider in-memory caching or Supabase edge functions to reduce latency.\n\nError Handling and Validation\n\n    Guard Clauses: Implement early returns to handle error conditions and invalid states.\n    Data Validation:\n        Use Zod schemas to validate all incoming data.\n        Provide clear error messages on validation failures.\n    Custom Error Types: Standardize error handling using custom error classes.\n\nData Management with Supabase and Drizzle\n\n    Supabase Integration:\n        Use Supabase for auth, realtime updates, and storage.\n        Securely manage Supabase credentials with environment variables.\n    Drizzle for Database Queries:\n        Use Drizzle as the ORM for all database operations.\n        Transaction Block Mandate: Always run database queries within a transaction block. This ensures consistency, rollback capabilities, and better error management.\n\nExample: Drizzle Transaction Block\n\n/**\n * Inserts a new user into the database within a transaction block.\n *\n * @param userData - Data for the new user validated by Zod.\n * @returns The inserted user record.\n */\nexport async function createUser(userData: { name: string; email: string; }) {\n  return await db.transaction(async (trx) => {\n    // Insert operation wrapped in a transaction block\n    const [newUser] = await trx.insert(users).values(userData).returning();\n    return newUser;\n  });\n}\n\nSecurity and Performance\n\n    Input Sanitization & Validation: Validate and sanitize all inputs using Zod before processing.\n    Environment Security: Leverage Deno’s secure environment configurations for managing secrets.\n    Performance Audits: Regularly review code for bottlenecks and security vulnerabilities.\n    Dependency Updates: Keep third-party modules up-to-date to mitigate risks.\n\nTesting and Documentation\n\n    Automated Testing:\n        Use Deno’s built-in test runner for unit and integration tests.\n        Consider integration with additional tools for end-to-end testing.\n    Code Documentation:\n        Use JSDoc/TSDoc for clear inline documentation.\n        Maintain comprehensive API and architecture documentation.\n    Comments: Provide clear comments for non-obvious logic, especially within transaction blocks.\n\nMethodology\n\n    Analytical Approach:\n        Decompose requirements into smaller, manageable components.\n        Evaluate security, performance, and maintainability throughout development.\n    Exploratory Evaluation:\n        Consider multiple architectural patterns and choose the optimal one based on trade-offs.\n    Iterative Refinement:\n        Continuously refine the code, considering edge cases and potential optimizations.\n        Employ thorough testing and audits during development.\n\nProcess\n\n    Deep Dive Analysis:\n        Understand requirements and align the solution with Deno, Hono, Zod, Supabase, and Drizzle best practices.\n    Planning:\n        Define clear module responsibilities (routes, controllers, services, etc.).\n        Use planning tags if necessary to document the design decisions.\n    Implementation:\n        Develop the solution with dynamic imports, caching, and transaction-based queries.\n        Ensure every database interaction with Drizzle is wrapped in a transaction block.\n    Review and Optimize:\n        Evaluate code for performance improvements and security vulnerabilities.\n    Finalization:\n        Ensure the solution is robust, secure, and ready for deployment with comprehensive tests.\n```yml lokal-link-be/.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml\nname: Quality Checks\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  quality:\n    name: Quality Checks\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Clone repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Install Deno\n        uses: denoland/setup-deno@v2\n        with:\n          deno-version: v2.x\n\n      - name: Check formatting\n        run: deno fmt\n\n      - name: Run linter\n        run: deno lint\n\n      - name: Type check\n        run: deno check **/*.ts\n\n      - name: Run tests\n        run: deno test\n```\n\ndoes deno will automatically find the file does has .test.ts? \n\nYes, Deno will automatically find all files with `.test.ts` extension when you run `deno test` without parameters. It searches through your project directory recursively and executes any file that matches:\n\n- `*_test.ts`\n- `*_test.js`\n- `*_test.jsx`\n- `*_test.tsx`\n- `*.test.ts`\n- `*.test.js`\n- `*.test.jsx`\n- `*.test.tsx`\n- `test.{ts,js,jsx,tsx}`\n\nSo your `.test.ts` files will be discovered and executed automatically with the `deno test` command in your workflow.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":75}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":60},"start":6519,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":76}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":61},"start":6986,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":77}}}],"summary":"Yes, Deno automatically finds an","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1277,"end":5824},"icon":"Library","label":"deno-hono-zod-drizzle-supabase","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":5825,"end":6454},"icon":"File","label":"lokal-link-be/.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml","metadata":{"path":"lokal-link-be/.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml"}}]}
