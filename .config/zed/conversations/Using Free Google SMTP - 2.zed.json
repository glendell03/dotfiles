Here's how you can configure it:\n\n```toml\n# Excerpt from: \n[auth.email.smtp]\nenabled = true\nhost = \"smtp.gmail.com\"\nport = 587\nuser = \"your-email@gmail.com\"\npass = \"your-app-password\" # Use an App Password if you have 2FA enabled\nadmin_email = \"your-email@gmail.com\" # Email that shows as sender\nsender_name = \"Dance Book App\"\n```\n\n### Steps to set up:\n\n1. **Enable \"Less secure app access\"**: If you don't have 2FA enabled, you need to allow less secure apps to access your Google account. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings -> Security -> Less secure app access and turning it on.\n\n2. **Generate an App Password**: If you have 2FA enabled, you need to generate an App Password. Go to your Google Account settings -> Security -> App passwords. Select the app and device you want to generate the password for, and Google will provide a 16-character password.\n\n3. **Replace placeholders**: Replace `your-email@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail address and `your-app-password` with the generated app password or your Gmail password if you don't have 2FA enabled.\n\n### Note:\nUsing Google's SMTP server for production applications is not recommended due to limitations and potential for your account to be flagged for suspicious activity. For production, consider using a dedicated email service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!\n```toml dance-book-app/supabase/config.toml:167-167\n# Excerpt from: auth.email.smtp > pass\nqKD#58Vwg7O%4%R!VNTS1^Q&i+k5DTS%Fz£s}v7-hrUd)5GU\n```\nOnly use letters, numbers, and common punctuation characters\nSure, here's a revised version of the password using only letters, numbers, and common punctuation characters:\n\n```toml\n# Excerpt from: auth.email.smtp > pass\nqKD58Vwg7O4RVNTS1Qik5DTSFzsv7hrUd5GU\n```\n\nThis password maintains a high level of complexity while adhering to your requirements.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":137}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":1602,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":138}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":23},"start":3045,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":139}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":94},"start":3251,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":140}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":95},"start":3540,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":141}}}],"summary":"Using Free Google SMTP","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3045,"end":3189},"icon":"TextSnippet","label":"dance-book-app/supabase/config.toml, Line 167","metadata":null}]}
