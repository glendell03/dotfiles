For user data, use Home Manager:\n\n```nix\n# In your home.nix\nhome.file.\"my-folder\" = {\n  source = ./path/to/folder;\n  recursive = true;\n};\n```\n\n2. For system-wide files, add to your configuration.nix:\n\n```nix\nenvironment.etc.\"my-folder\" = {\n  source = ./path/to/folder;\n  recursive = true;\n};\n```\n\n3. For persistent data across reinstalls, create a separate partition and add to hardware-configuration.nix:\n\n```nix\nfileSystems.\"/persist\" = {\n  device = \"/dev/disk/by-label/persist\";\n  fsType = \"ext4\";\n  neededForBoot = true;\n};\n```\n\nThen symlink or bind-mount:\n\n```nix\nsystem.activationScripts.persistentFolders = ''\n  mkdir -p /persist/my-folder\n  ln -sfn /persist/my-folder /path/to/destination\n'';\n```\nyes i want to persist data across reinstall\nlike save the neovim config etc\n\nFor persisting data across reinstalls like your Neovim config, you need to set up a persistent partition:\n\n1. Create a separate partition for persistent data:\n\n```bash\n# Label an existing partition\nsudo e2label /dev/sdXY persist\n\n# Or create a new one\nsudo parted /dev/sdX mkpart primary ext4 100GB 150GB\nsudo mkfs.ext4 -L persist /dev/sdXY\n```\n\n2. Mount it in your hardware-configuration.nix:\n\n```nix\nfileSystems.\"/persist\" = {\n  device = \"/dev/disk/by-label/persist\";\n  fsType = \"ext4\";\n  neededForBoot = true;\n  options = [\"defaults\" \"noatime\"];\n};\n```\n\n3. In your configuration.nix, set up impermanence for your home directory:\n\n```nix\n{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:\n\nlet \n  # Install the impermanence module if not already added\n  impermanence = builtins.fetchTarball \"https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence/archive/master.tar.gz\";\nin\n{\n  imports = [ \"${impermanence}/nixos.nix\" ];\n\n  environment.persistence.\"/persist\" = {\n    directories = [\n      \"/etc/nixos\"     # Keep NixOS config\n      \"/var/log\"\n      \"/var/lib\"\n    ];\n    files = [\n      \"/etc/machine-id\"\n    ];\n  };\n\n  programs.fuse.userAllowOther = true;  # Needed for home directory persistence\n}\n```\n\n4. For your home directory (including Neovim config), add this to your home-manager configuration:\n\n```nix\n{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:\n\nlet\n  impermanence = builtins.fetchTarball \"https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence/archive/master.tar.gz\";\nin\n{\n  imports = [ \"${impermanence}/home-manager.nix\" ];\n\n  home.persistence.\"/persist/home/${config.home.username}\" = {\n    directories = [\n      \".config/nvim\"\n      \".local/share/nvim\"\n      \".ssh\"\n      \"Documents\"\n      \"Downloads\"\n      \"Pictures\"\n      # Add other directories you want to persist\n    ];\n    files = [\n      \".bash_history\"\n      # Add other files you want to persist\n    ];\n    allowOther = true;\n  };\n}\n```\n\nAfter setting this up, reboot, and your specified directories like Neovim config will persist across reinstalls as long as you keep that /persist partition intact.\nlike for example installing nixos pasting this config file in a new computer will have my neovim configuration ready to go?\nNo, the method I described requires you to maintain a separate partition that survives reinstalls. Let me give you a better solution for your use case.\n\nTo have your Neovim config automatically installed on any new NixOS system, you should:\n\n1. Create a NixOS module that includes your Neovim configuration:\n\n```nix\n# neovim-config.nix\n{ config, pkgs, ... }:\n\n{\n  programs.neovim = {\n    enable = true;\n    defaultEditor = true;\n    configure = {\n      customRC = ''\n        \" Your neovim config here\n        set number\n        set relativenumber\n        \" etc...\n      '';\n      packages.myVimPackage = with pkgs.vimPlugins; {\n        start = [\n          vim-nix\n          nvim-treesitter\n          telescope-nvim\n          # Add your plugins here\n        ];\n      };\n    };\n  };\n  \n  # You can also copy config files directly\n  home.file.\".config/nvim\" = {\n    source = ./nvim-files; # Directory with your nvim config\n    recursive = true;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n2. Add this module to your configuration.nix:\n\n```nix\n# configuration.nix\n{ config, pkgs, ... }:\n\n{\n  imports = [\n    ./hardware-configuration.nix\n    ./neovim-config.nix\n    # Other modules\n  ];\n  \n  # Rest of your system config\n}\n```\n\n3. If using Home Manager (recommended), add it to your home.nix instead:\n\n```nix\n# home.nix\n{ config, pkgs, ... }:\n\n{\n  imports = [\n    ./neovim-config.nix\n    # Other modules\n  ];\n  \n  # Rest of your home manager config\n}\n```\n\n4. For a new computer, just copy your entire nixos configuration directory (including the neovim-config.nix and any nvim-files directory), and then run:\n\n```bash\nsudo nixos-rebuild switch\n```\n\nThis approach lets you keep your Neovim configuration as code in your NixOS configuration, so you can simply copy the config files to any new system and have an identical setup. No separate partition needed.\noh i see! so saving a folder is not possible in nixos?\ncause i want to reformat my laptop and i am setting up a nixos so that on my new laptop i have all the files and config ready to go.\nCorrect, NixOS doesn't natively support saving arbitrary folders across reinstalls because it follows a declarative approach where system state is defined in configuration files.\n\nFor your use case of reformatting your laptop, here are your best options:\n\n1. **Declarative configuration (the NixOS way)**: \n   - Define all your system configs in Nix files\n   - For Neovim, either use the `programs.neovim` configuration or include your config files directly\n   - Store these Nix configs in a git repository\n\n2. **Backup important folders**:\n   - Copy your important folders to an external drive or cloud storage\n   - After reinstall, manually restore them\n\n3. **Create a custom ISO with your files**:\n   - Use nixos-generators to create a custom ISO that includes your files\n   - But this is more advanced and may be overkill\n\nFor your specific use case, I recommend:\n\n```bash\n# Before reformatting, back up your config files\nrsync -av ~/.config/nvim/ /path/to/backup/nvim/\nrsync -av /etc/nixos/ /path/to/backup/nixos/\n\n# After reinstalling, restore them\nrsync -av /path/to/backup/nvim/ ~/.config/nvim/\nrsync -av /path/to/backup/nixos/ /etc/nixos/\n```\n\nThen rebuild your system:\n```bash\nsudo nixos-rebuild switch\n```\n\nThis isn't automatic persistence, but it's the most straightforward way to transfer your config to a fresh NixOS install.\nhow about orbstack supports exporting the vm \nwhen i save the the file inside the vm it will also be imported?\nYes, OrbStack does support exporting VMs, and it will include all files inside the VM when you export it.\n\nTo export your NixOS VM from OrbStack:\n\n1. Open OrbStack\n2. Right-click on your NixOS VM\n3. Select \"Export...\" from the context menu\n4. Choose a location to save the exported VM file\n5. Wait for the export to complete\n\nThis exported file will contain everything inside your VM, including:\n- All your system files\n- All your configuration files\n- All your home directory files (including Neovim config)\n- The entire state of your VM\n\nWhen you import this VM on another computer with OrbStack:\n\n1. Open OrbStack\n2. Click \"Add\" or go to File → Import\n3. Select your exported VM file\n4. Wait for the import to complete\n\nAll your files, configurations, and state will be preserved exactly as they were when you exported. This includes your Neovim configuration and any other files you've created or modified.\n\nThis is a much more direct approach than trying to use NixOS's declarative configuration system for this particular use case.\n\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1387}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":45},"start":1362,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1388}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":46},"start":2171,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1389}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":98},"start":2215,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1390}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":151},"start":2248,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1391}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":152},"start":4270,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1392}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":352},"start":4394,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1393}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":353},"start":6214,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1394}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":539},"start":6269,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1395}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":963},"start":6402,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1396}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":964},"start":7742,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1397}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1175},"start":7788,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1398}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1356},"start":7853,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1399}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1357},"start":8894,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1400}}}],"summary":"# NixOS Persisting Folders","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null}]}
