Update the code like this:\n\n```ts\nif (eventType === \"user.created\") {\n    if (!id) return;\n    \n    // Get IP from Clerk webhook data\n    const ipAddress = req.headers.get(\"x-forwarded-for\") ?? \n                     req.headers.get(\"x-real-ip\") ?? \n                     \"unknown\";\n\n    await db.transaction(async (tx) => {\n      await tx\n        .insert(schema.legalCompliance)\n        .values({ \n          legalAcceptedAt: new Date(), \n          userId: id, \n          ip: ipAddress \n        });\n    });\n}\n```\n\nNote: This assumes your webhook handler function receives the request object (commonly named `req`). If you didn't show the function signature in the excerpt, make sure you have access to the request object.\n\nThe code tries multiple headers because IP addresses can be forwarded through proxies. X-Forwarded-For is the most common, with X-Real-IP as fallback.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":567}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":24},"start":1644,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":568}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":45},"start":1678,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":569}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":46},"start":2614,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":570}}}],"summary":"Get IP from Clerk Webhook","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1277,"end":1621},"icon":"TextSnippet","label":"carsu/apps/nextjs/src/app/api/clerk/webhook/route.ts, Lines 73 to 81","metadata":null}]}
