Let me know if you need those features.\nThis behavior is useful for conventional query building, i.e. when you create the whole query at once. However, it becomes a problem when you want to build a query dynamically, i.e. if you have a shared function that takes a query builder and enhances it. To solve this problem, Drizzle provides a special ‘dynamic’ mode for query builders, which removes the restriction of invoking methods only once. To enable it, you need to call .$dynamic() on a query builder.\n\nLet’s see how it works by implementing a simple withPagination function that adds LIMIT and OFFSET clauses to a query based on the provided page number and an optional page size:\n\nfunction withPagination<T extends PgSelect>(\n\tqb: T,\n\tpage: number = 1,\n\tpageSize: number = 10,\n) {\n\treturn qb.limit(pageSize).offset((page - 1) * pageSize);\n}\n\nconst query = db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.id, 1));\nwithPagination(query, 1); // ❌ Type error - the query builder is not in dynamic mode\n\nconst dynamicQuery = query.$dynamic();\nwithPagination(dynamicQuery, 1); // ✅ OK\n\nNote that the withPagination function is generic, which allows you to modify the result type of the query builder inside it, for example by adding a join:\n\nfunction withFriends<T extends PgSelect>(qb: T) {\n\treturn qb.leftJoin(friends, eq(friends.userId, users.id));\n}\n\nlet query = db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.id, 1)).$dynamic();\nquery = withFriends(query);\n\nThis is possible, because PgSelect and other similar types are specifically designed to be used in dynamic query building. They can only be used in dynamic mode.\nDrizzle ORM is designed to be a thin typed layer on top of SQL. We truly believe we’ve designed the best way to operate an SQL database from TypeScript and it’s time to make it better.\n\nRelational queries are meant to provide you with a great developer experience for querying nested relational data from an SQL database, avoiding multiple joins and complex data mappings.\n\nIt is an extension to the existing schema definition and query builder. You can opt-in to use it based on your needs. We’ve made sure you have both the best-in-class developer experience and performance.\n\nimport * as schema from './schema';\nimport { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/...';\n\nconst db = drizzle({ schema });\n\nconst result = await db.query.users.findMany({\n\twith: {\n\t\tposts: true\t\t\t\n\t},\n});\n\n[{\n\tid: 10,\n\tname: \"Dan\",\n\tposts: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tid: 1,\n\t\t\tcontent: \"SQL is awesome\",\n\t\t\tauthorId: 10,\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tid: 2,\n\t\t\tcontent: \"But check relational queries\",\n\t\t\tauthorId: 10,\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}]\nthere is dynamic and findMany as a senior developer what is the best to use?\nFor modern TypeScript/Node.js applications, `findMany` with relational queries is the better choice because:\n\n1. Cleaner Code & DX:\n```ts\n// Relational queries (better)\nconst shops = await db.query.shops.findMany({\n  with: {\n    address: true,\n    schedule: true\n  }\n});\n\n// vs Dynamic (more verbose)\nconst shops = await db\n  .select()\n  .from(shops)\n  .$dynamic()\n  .leftJoin(shopAddresses, eq(shops.id, shopAddresses.shopId))\n  .leftJoin(shopSchedules, eq(shops.id, shopSchedules\n```ts lokal-link-be/src/features/shops/services/shops.services.ts:20-31\n// Excerpt from: class ShopsService > static async getById( )\nstatic async getById(id: string, { includeAddresses = false, includeSchedules = false })  {\n    const shop = await db.query.shops.findFirst({\n      where: eq(shops.id, id),\n      with: {\n        shopAddresses: includeAddresses,\n        schedules: includeSchedules,\n        \n      },\n    });\n\n    return shop;\n  }\n```\nwhat is the best and optimize way to code this? the \"with\"\n\nFor complex queries with dynamic relations and type safety, relational queries (findMany/findFirst) are generally better. Here's the optimized version:\n\n```ts\ntype GetShopOptions = {\n  includeAddresses?: boolean;\n  includeSchedules?: boolean;\n};\n\nstatic async getById(id: string, options: GetShopOptions = {}) {\n  const { includeAddresses = false, includeSchedules = false } = options;\n\n  const shop = await db.query.shops.findFirst({\n    where: eq(shops.id, id),\n    columns: {\n      id: true,\n      name: true,\n      description: true,\n      email: true,\n      phoneNumber: true,\n      type: true,\n      status: true,\n      createdAt: true,\n      updatedAt: true,\n    },\n    with: {\n      ...(includeAddresses && { shopAddresses: true }),\n      ...(includeSchedules && { schedules: true }),\n    },\n  });\n\n  return shop;\n}\n```\n\nWhy this approach is better:\n1. Relational queries (`findFirst`) provide:\n   - Better type inference\n   - Cleaner nested relations handling\n   - More readable code\n   - Better performance (Drizzle optimizes the underlying SQL)\n\n2. Using `columns` explicitly:\n   - Controls exactly what data is fetched\n   - Reduces network payload\n   - Makes the response structure clear\n\n3. Dynamic `with` using spread operator:\n   - Only includes relations when needed\n   - Prevents unnecessary joins\n   - More maintainable than building dynamic queries\n\nThe dynamic query builder (.$dynamic()) is better when:\n- You need complex custom SQL\n- Building highly dynamic queries\n- Need more control over the exact SQL generated\n- Working with raw SQL or custom query builders\nfor the columns yes i agree but can we also put that in the options params? but can  we make it dynamic like if there is database changes it should be sync. default value is all but when called with specific columns, it should only fetch those columns.\nHere's the optimized version with dynamic columns:\n\n```ts\nimport { InferSelectModel } from 'drizzle-orm';\n\ntype ShopColumns = keyof InferSelectModel<typeof shops>;\n\ntype GetShopOptions = {\n  includeAddresses?: boolean;\n  includeSchedules?: boolean;\n  columns?: ShopColumns[] | '*';\n};\n\nstatic async getById(id: string, options: GetShopOptions = {}) {\n  const { \n    includeAddresses = false, \n    includeSchedules = false,\n    columns = '*'\n  } = options;\n\n  const shop = await db.query.shops.findFirst({\n    where: eq(shops.id, id),\n    columns: columns === '*' \n      ? true // fetches all columns\n      : Object.fromEntries(columns.map(col => [col, true])),\n    with: {\n      ...(includeAddresses && { shopAddresses: true }),\n      ...(includeSchedules && { schedules: true }),\n    },\n  });\n\n  return shop;\n}\n```\n\nUsage examples:\n```ts\n// Get all columns\nawait ShopsService.getById('123');\n\n// Get specific columns\nawait ShopsService.getById('123', { \n  columns: ['id', 'name', 'email']\n});\n\n// With relations and specific columns\nawait ShopsService.getById('123', {\n  columns: ['id', 'name'],\n  includeAddresses: true\n});\n```\n\nThis approach:\n- Uses `InferSelectModel` to automatically get column types from schema\n- Allows '*' for all columns or specific column array\n- Stays in sync with database schema changes\n- Maintains type safety\n- Converts column array to Drizzle's expected format\n```ts lokal-link-be/src/features/shops/services/shops.services.ts\nimport { eq } from \"drizzle-orm\";\nimport {\n  shopAddresses,\n  shops,\n  shopSchedules,\n} from \"@/db/schema/shops.schema.ts\";\nimport { db } from \"@/db/index.ts\";\nimport { ShopColumns, ShopInsert } from \"@/features/shops/shops.types.ts\";\n\nexport class ShopsService {\n  static async create(input: ShopInsert, tx = db) {\n    const [shop] = await tx\n      .insert(shops)\n      .values(input)\n      .returning();\n\n    return shop;\n  }\n\n  static async getById(\n    id: string,\n    options: {\n      includeAddresses?: boolean;\n      includeSchedules?: boolean;\n      columns?: ShopColumns[] | \"*\";\n    },\n  ) {\n    const {\n      includeAddresses = false,\n      includeSchedules = false,\n      columns = \"*\",\n    } = options;\n\n    const shop = await db.query.shops.findFirst({\n      where: eq(shops.id, id),\n      columns: columns === \"*\"\n        ? undefined\n        : Object.entries(columns.map((col) => [col, true])),\n      with: {\n        ...(options.includeAddresses && { shopAddresses: true }),\n        ...(options.includeSchedules && { schedules: true }),\n      },\n    });\n\n    return shop;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```ts lokal-link-be/src/features/shops/services/shops.services.ts:36-38\n// Excerpt from: class ShopsService > static async getById( )\n columns: columns === \"*\"\n        ? undefined\n        : Object.entries(columns.map((col) => [col, true])),\n```\ngot this error please fix this\ndeno-ts: Type '[string, (boolean | \"id\" | \"name\" | \"description\" | \"image\" | \"followersCount\" | \"slug\" | \"createdAt\" | \"updatedAt\" | \"ownerProfileId\")[]][] | undefined' is not assignable to type '{ name?: boolean | undefined; description?: boolean | undefined; image?: boolean | undefined; followersCount?: boolean | undefined; slug?: boolean | undefined; ownerProfileId?: boolean | undefined; id?: boolean | undefined; createdAt?: boolean | undefined; updatedAt?: boolean | undefined; } | undefined'.\n  Type '[string, (boolean | \"id\" | \"name\" | \"description\" | \"image\" | \"followersCount\" | \"slug\" | \"createdAt\" | \"updatedAt\" | \"ownerProfileId\")[]][]' has no properties in common with type '{ name?: boolean | undefined; description?: boolean | undefined; image?: boolean | undefined; followersCount?: boolean | undefined; slug?: boolean | undefined; ownerProfileId?: boolean | undefined; id?: boolean | undefined; createdAt?: boolean | undefined; updatedAt?: boolean | undefined; }'.\nThe error is in the Object.entries conversion.
