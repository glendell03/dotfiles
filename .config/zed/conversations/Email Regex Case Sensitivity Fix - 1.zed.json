Your task is to produce the most optimized and maintainable Next.js code, following best practices and adhering to the principles of clean code and robust architecture.\n    \n        ### Objective\n        - Create a Next.js solution that is not only functional but also adheres to the best practices in performance, security, and maintainability.\n    \n        ### Code Style and Structure\n        - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.\n        - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.\n        - Favor iteration and modularization over code duplication.\n        - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).\n        - Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.\n        - Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).\n    \n        ### Optimization and Best Practices\n        - Minimize the use of `'use client'`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; favor React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js SSR features.\n        - Implement dynamic imports for code splitting and optimization.\n        - Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach.\n        - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.\n    \n        ### Error Handling and Validation\n        - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:\n          - Use early returns for error conditions.\n          - Implement guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.\n          - Use custom error types for consistent error handling.\n    \n        ### UI and Styling\n        - Use modern UI frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI) for styling.\n        - Implement consistent design and responsive patterns across platforms.\n    \n        ### State Management and Data Fetching\n        - Use modern state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, TanStack React Query) to handle global state and data fetching.\n        - Implement validation using Zod for schema validation.\n    \n        ### Security and Performance\n        - Implement proper error handling, user input validation, and secure coding practices.\n        - Follow performance optimization techniques, such as reducing load times and improving rendering efficiency.\n    \n        ### Testing and Documentation\n        - Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.\n        - Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic.\n        - Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense.\n    \n        ### Methodology\n        1. **System 2 Thinking**: Approach the problem with analytical rigor. Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable parts and thoroughly consider each step before implementation.\n        2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences. Use a structured approach to explore different paths and select the optimal one.\n        3. **Iterative Refinement**: Before finalizing the code, consider improvements, edge cases, and optimizations. Iterate through potential enhancements to ensure the final solution is robust.\n    \n        **Process**:\n        1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the task at hand, considering the technical requirements and constraints.\n        2. **Planning**: Develop a clear plan that outlines the architectural structure and flow of the solution, using <PLANNING> tags if necessary.\n        3. **Implementation**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring that each part adheres to the specified best practices.\n        4. **Review and Optimize**: Perform a review of the code, looking for areas of potential optimization and improvement.\n        5. **Finalization**: Finalize the code by ensuring it meets all requirements, is secure, and is performant.\n        \n```ts carsu/packages/types/src/utils.ts:5-5\n// Excerpt from: function validateEmail( )\nemail.match(/^[a-z\\d+_.-]+@[a-z\\d.-]+\\.[a-z]+$/) !== null;\n```\ncan you add upper case letter here\nemail can accept upper case letter here\n\nHere's the modified regex that accepts uppercase letters:\n\n```ts\nemail.match(/^[a-zA-Z\\d+_.-]+@[a-zA-Z\\d.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]+$/) !== null;\n```\n\nChanges made:\n- Added `A-Z` to first character group for local part\n- Added `A-Z` to domain part\n- Added `A-Z` to TLD part\n\nThis regex now accepts both uppercase and lowercase letters in all parts of the email address.\n\nNote: While this allows uppercase in validation, email addresses are case-insensitive by RFC 5321, so you might want to `toLowerCase()` before storing or comparing.\ni have a question about the email since we are accepting uppercase letters here it will create a new email address with uppercase letters. should we convert it to lowercase before storing?\n\nYes, absolutely! You should convert the email to lowercase before storing. Here's why:\n\n1. Email addresses are case-insensitive (Test@gmail.com and test@gmail.com are the same)\n2. It prevents duplicate accounts with different cases\n3. Makes searching and comparing emails consistent\n\nHere's how to handle it:\n\n```ts\n// Validation\nconst isValidEmail = email.match(/^[a-zA-Z\\d+_.-]+@[a-zA-Z\\d.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]+$/) !== null;\n\n// Before storing\nconst normalizedEmail = email.toLowerCase();\n\n// Now store normalizedEmail in your database\n```\n\nThis gives you the best of both worlds:\n- Flexible validation that accepts user input with any case\n- Consistent storage that prevents case-related issues\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":263}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":34},"start":5512,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":264}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":53},"start":5553,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":265}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":54},"start":6076,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":266}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":236},"start":6266,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":267}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":237},"start":6956,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":268}}}],"summary":"Email Regex Case Sensitivity Fix","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1278,"end":5326},"icon":"Library","label":"next-tw-zod-zustand-shad","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":5327,"end":5476},"icon":"TextSnippet","label":"carsu/packages/types/src/utils.ts, Line 5","metadata":null}]}
