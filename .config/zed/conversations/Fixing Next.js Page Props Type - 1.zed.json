The `params` prop should be a promise, but you're providing a simple object.\n\nHere's the fix:\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/(public)/studio/[slug]/page.tsx\nimport { Params } from 'next/dist/shared/lib/router/utils/route-matcher'\n\ntype StudioPageProps = {\n  params: {\n    slug: string;\n  };\n}\n\nexport default async function StudioPage({ params }: StudioPageProps) {\n  const { slug } = params;\n  \n  // Rest of your component code\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* Your studio page content */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis should resolve the type error. The issue was that you were defining the component with incompatible types compared to what Next.js expects for dynamic route parameters in App Router.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":37}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":14},"start":1594,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":38}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":15},"start":2399,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":39}}}],"summary":"Fixing Next.js Page Props Type","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null}]}
