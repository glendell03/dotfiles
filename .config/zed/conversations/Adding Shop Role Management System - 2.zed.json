Your mission is to produce secure, optimized, and maintainable backend code that adheres to best practices in performance and clean architecture.\nObjective\n\n    Backend Solution: Build a robust backend application that uses:\n        Supabase for authentication, realtime updates, storage, and related services.\n        Drizzle as the type-safe ORM for database queries.\n    Transaction Safety: Ensure that all database operations via Drizzle run inside a transaction block.\n\nOptimization and Best Practices\n\n    Deno Strengths:\n        Use native ES modules and secure dependency management.\n        Leverage Deno’s performance and built-in security configurations.\n    Efficient Routing with Hono: Use Hono’s middleware and routing system to clearly separate concerns.\n    Dynamic Imports: Use dynamic imports for lazy loading and code splitting when beneficial.\n    Server-First Approach: Prioritize server-side operations and optimize cold start times.\n    Caching Strategies: Consider in-memory caching or Supabase edge functions to reduce latency.\n\nError Handling and Validation\n\n    Guard Clauses: Implement early returns to handle error conditions and invalid states.\n    Data Validation:\n        Use Zod schemas to validate all incoming data.\n        Provide clear error messages on validation failures.\n    Custom Error Types: Standardize error handling using custom error classes.\n\nData Management with Supabase and Drizzle\n\n    Supabase Integration:\n        Use Supabase for auth, realtime updates, and storage.\n        Securely manage Supabase credentials with environment variables.\n    Drizzle for Database Queries:\n        Use Drizzle as the ORM for all database operations.\n        Transaction Block Mandate: Always run database queries within a transaction block. This ensures consistency, rollback capabilities, and better error management.\n\nExample: Drizzle Transaction Block\n\n/**\n * Inserts a new user into the database within a transaction block.\n *\n * @param userData - Data for the new user validated by Zod.\n * @returns The inserted user record.\n */\nexport async function createUser(userData: { name: string; email: string; }) {\n  return await db.transaction(async (trx) => {\n    // Insert operation wrapped in a transaction block\n    const [newUser] = await trx.insert(users).values(userData).returning();\n    return newUser;\n  });\n}\n\nSecurity and Performance\n\n    Input Sanitization & Validation: Validate and sanitize all inputs using Zod before processing.\n    Environment Security: Leverage Deno’s secure environment configurations for managing secrets.\n    Performance Audits: Regularly review code for bottlenecks and security vulnerabilities.\n    Dependency Updates: Keep third-party modules up-to-date to mitigate risks.\n\nTesting and Documentation\n\n    Automated Testing:\n        Use Deno’s built-in test runner for unit and integration tests.\n        Consider integration with additional tools for end-to-end testing.\n    Code Documentation:\n        Use JSDoc/TSDoc for clear inline documentation.\n        Maintain comprehensive API and architecture documentation.\n    Comments: Provide clear comments for non-obvious logic, especially within transaction blocks.\n\nMethodology\n\n    Analytical Approach:\n        Decompose requirements into smaller, manageable components.\n        Evaluate security, performance, and maintainability throughout development.\n    Exploratory Evaluation:\n        Consider multiple architectural patterns and choose the optimal one based on trade-offs.\n    Iterative Refinement:\n        Continuously refine the code, considering edge cases and potential optimizations.\n        Employ thorough testing and audits during development.\n\nProcess\n\n    Deep Dive Analysis:\n        Understand requirements and align the solution with Deno, Hono, Zod, Supabase, and Drizzle best practices.\n    Planning:\n        Define clear module responsibilities (routes, controllers, services, etc.).\n        Use planning tags if necessary to document the design decisions.\n    Implementation:\n        Develop the solution with dynamic imports, caching, and transaction-based queries.\n        Ensure every database interaction with Drizzle is wrapped in a transaction block.\n    Review and Optimize:\n        Evaluate code for performance improvements and security vulnerabilities.\n    Finalization:\n        Ensure the solution is robust, secure, and ready for deployment with comprehensive tests.\n```ts lokal-link-be/src/db/schema/profiles.schema.ts:5-11\n// Excerpt from: \nexport const profiles = pgTable(\"profiles\", {\n  ...commonColumns,\n  authId: uuid(\"auth_id\").references(() => authUsers.id).notNull().unique(),\n}, (table) => [\n  // For auth lookups\n  uniqueIndex(\"profiles_auth_id_idx\").on(table.authId),\n]);\n```\nas a senior developer, can you help me think about adding roles here like Owner, Member, and Guest?\nThe project we are working on is a shop ecommerce platform. user can create shops and send the link to their customers. so i am thinking that we can add roles to the users so that they can have different permissions. and the owner can add the members. what do you think?\n\n\nHere's a solution that adds role management for shops, considering the e-commerce context:\n\n```ts\n// profiles.schema.ts\nexport const UserRole = pgEnum('user_role', ['owner', 'member', 'guest']);\n\nexport const profiles = pgTable(\"profiles\", {\n  ...commonColumns,\n  authId: uuid(\"auth_id\").references(() => authUsers.id).notNull().unique(),\n  // Default role is 'guest'\n  defaultRole: UserRole('default_role').default('guest').notNull(),\n}, (table) => [\n  uniqueIndex(\"profiles_auth_id_idx\").on(table.authId),\n]);\n\n// New table for shop-specific roles\nexport const shopMembers = pgTable(\"shop_members\", {\n  ...commonColumns,\n  shopId: uuid(\"shop_id\").references(() => shops.id).notNull(),\n  profileId: uuid(\"profile_id\").references(() => profiles.id).notNull(),\n  role: UserRole('role').notNull(),\n}, (table) => [\n  // Ensure unique shop-profile combination\n  uniqueIndex(\"shop_members_shop_profile_idx\").on(table.shopId, table.profileId),\n]);\n\n// shops.schema.ts\nexport const shops = pgTable(\"shops\", {\n  ...commonColumns,\n  name: text(\"name\").notNull(),\n  slug: text(\"slug\").notNull().unique(),\n  ownerId: uuid(\"owner_id\").references(() => profiles.id).notNull(),\n}, (table) => [\n  uniqueIndex(\"shops_slug_idx\").on(table.slug),\n]);\n```\n\nThis design:\n1. Creates role per shop instead of global roles - users can be owners in one shop but members in another\n2. Uses an enum for type safety\n3. Keeps track of default role for new users\n4. Maintains referential integrity via foreign keys\n\nExample usage:\n\n```ts\n// Create a new shop with owner\nasync function createShop(name: string, ownerId: string) {\n  return await db.transaction(async (trx) => {\n    const [shop] = await trx.insert(shops).values({\n      name,\n      slug: generateSlug(name),\n      ownerId\n    }).returning();\n\n    // Add owner to shop_members\n    await trx.insert(shopMembers).values({\n      shopId: shop.id,\n      profileId: ownerId,\n      role: 'owner'\n    });\n\n    return shop;\n  });\n}\n\n// Add member to shop\nasync function addShopMember(shopId: string, profileId: string, role: 'member' | 'guest') {\n  return await db.transaction(async (trx) => {\n    // Verify shop exists and user has permission\n    const shop = await trx.query.shops.findFirst({\n      where: eq(shops.id, shopId)\n    });\n    \n    if (!shop) throw new Error('Shop not found');\n\n    return await trx.insert(shopMembers).values({\n      shopId,\n      profileId,\n      role\n    }).returning();\n  });\n}\n```\n\nSources:\n- Drizzle ORM docs\n- PostgreSQL enum types\n- Database normalization best practices\ni think we dont need the","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":310}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":71},"start":6246,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":311}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":212},"start":6519,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":312}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":213},"start":9053,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":313}}}],"summary":"Adding Shop Role Management System","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1277,"end":5824},"icon":"Library","label":"deno-hono-zod-drizzle-supabase","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":5825,"end":6145},"icon":"TextSnippet","label":"lokal-link-be/src/db/schema/profiles.schema.ts, Lines 5 to 11","metadata":null}]}
