Your mission is to produce secure, optimized, and maintainable backend code that adheres to best practices in performance and clean architecture.\nObjective\n\n    Backend Solution: Build a robust backend application that uses:\n        Supabase for authentication, realtime updates, storage, and related services.\n        Drizzle as the type-safe ORM for database queries.\n    Transaction Safety: Ensure that all database operations via Drizzle run inside a transaction block.\n\nOptimization and Best Practices\n\n    Deno Strengths:\n        Use native ES modules and secure dependency management.\n        Leverage Deno’s performance and built-in security configurations.\n    Efficient Routing with Hono: Use Hono’s middleware and routing system to clearly separate concerns.\n    Dynamic Imports: Use dynamic imports for lazy loading and code splitting when beneficial.\n    Server-First Approach: Prioritize server-side operations and optimize cold start times.\n    Caching Strategies: Consider in-memory caching or Supabase edge functions to reduce latency.\n\nError Handling and Validation\n\n    Guard Clauses: Implement early returns to handle error conditions and invalid states.\n    Data Validation:\n        Use Zod schemas to validate all incoming data.\n        Provide clear error messages on validation failures.\n    Custom Error Types: Standardize error handling using custom error classes.\n\nData Management with Supabase and Drizzle\n\n    Supabase Integration:\n        Use Supabase for auth, realtime updates, and storage.\n        Securely manage Supabase credentials with environment variables.\n    Drizzle for Database Queries:\n        Use Drizzle as the ORM for all database operations.\n        Transaction Block Mandate: Always run database queries within a transaction block. This ensures consistency, rollback capabilities, and better error management.\n\nExample: Drizzle Transaction Block\n\n/**\n * Inserts a new user into the database within a transaction block.\n *\n * @param userData - Data for the new user validated by Zod.\n * @returns The inserted user record.\n */\nexport async function createUser(userData: { name: string; email: string; }) {\n  return await db.transaction(async (trx) => {\n    // Insert operation wrapped in a transaction block\n    const [newUser] = await trx.insert(users).values(userData).returning();\n    return newUser;\n  });\n}\n\nSecurity and Performance\n\n    Input Sanitization & Validation: Validate and sanitize all inputs using Zod before processing.\n    Environment Security: Leverage Deno’s secure environment configurations for managing secrets.\n    Performance Audits: Regularly review code for bottlenecks and security vulnerabilities.\n    Dependency Updates: Keep third-party modules up-to-date to mitigate risks.\n\nTesting and Documentation\n\n    Automated Testing:\n        Use Deno’s built-in test runner for unit and integration tests.\n        Consider integration with additional tools for end-to-end testing.\n    Code Documentation:\n        Use JSDoc/TSDoc for clear inline documentation.\n        Maintain comprehensive API and architecture documentation.\n    Comments: Provide clear comments for non-obvious logic, especially within transaction blocks.\n\nMethodology\n\n    Analytical Approach:\n        Decompose requirements into smaller, manageable components.\n        Evaluate security, performance, and maintainability throughout development.\n    Exploratory Evaluation:\n        Consider multiple architectural patterns and choose the optimal one based on trade-offs.\n    Iterative Refinement:\n        Continuously refine the code, considering edge cases and potential optimizations.\n        Employ thorough testing and audits during development.\n\nProcess\n\n    Deep Dive Analysis:\n        Understand requirements and align the solution with Deno, Hono, Zod, Supabase, and Drizzle best practices.\n    Planning:\n        Define clear module responsibilities (routes, controllers, services, etc.).\n        Use planning tags if necessary to document the design decisions.\n    Implementation:\n        Develop the solution with dynamic imports, caching, and transaction-based queries.\n        Ensure every database interaction with Drizzle is wrapped in a transaction block.\n    Review and Optimize:\n        Evaluate code for performance improvements and security vulnerabilities.\n    Finalization:\n        Ensure the solution is robust, secure, and ready for deployment with comprehensive tests.\n```ts lokal-link-be/src/features/address/services/address.services.ts\nimport {\n  AddressInsert,\n  AddressSelect,\n} from \"@/features/address/address.types.ts\";\nimport { db } from \"@/db/index.ts\";\nimport { address as addressSchema } from \"@/db/schema/index.ts\";\nimport { and, eq } from \"drizzle-orm\";\nimport { Transaction } from \"@/types/drizzle.type.ts\";\n\nexport class AddressService {\n  static async create(input: AddressInsert, trx: Transaction = db) {\n    const [address] = await trx.insert(addressSchema).values(input).returning();\n\n    return address;\n  }\n\n  static async findExisting(input: AddressSelect, trx: Transaction = db) {\n    return await trx\n      .select()\n      .from(addressSchema)\n      .where(\n        and(\n          eq(addressSchema.country, input.country),\n          eq(addressSchema.city, input.city),\n          eq(addressSchema.zip, input.zip),\n        ),\n      )\n      .limit(1)\n      .then((rows) => rows[0] || null);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nas a senior developer i want to clean the code i found that trx is constantly using and each static we need the trx can we put it in constructor? or if you have better suggestions, please provide them.\nsomething like this\ndb.transaction(async (trx) => {\n  AddressService(trx).update()\n\n  // Use addressService here\n});\nis this possible?\n\nHere's the cleaned-up version using a constructor pattern:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  AddressInsert,\n  AddressSelect,\n} from \"@/features/address/address.types.ts\";\nimport { db } from \"@/db/index.ts\";\nimport { address as addressSchema } from \"@/db/schema/index.ts\";\nimport { and, eq } from \"drizzle-orm\";\nimport { Transaction } from \"@/types/drizzle.type.ts\";\n\nexport class AddressService {\n  constructor(private trx: Transaction = db) {}\n\n  async create(input: AddressInsert) {\n    const [address] = await this.trx\n      .insert(addressSchema)\n      .values(input)\n      .returning();\n    return address;\n  }\n\n  async findExisting(input: AddressSelect) {\n    return await this.trx\n      .select()\n      .from(addressSchema)\n      .where(\n        and(\n          eq(addressSchema.country, input.country),\n          eq(addressSchema.city, input.city),\n          eq(addressSchema.zip, input.zip),\n        ),\n      )\n      .limit(1)\n      .then((rows) => rows[0] || null);\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage:\n// Inside transaction:\nawait db.transaction(async (trx) => {\n  const addressService = new AddressService(trx);\n  await addressService.create({ /* ... */ });\n});\n\n// Outside transaction:\nconst addressService = new AddressService();\nawait addressService.findExisting({ /* ... */ });\n```\n\nKey changes:\n- Removed static methods\n- Added constructor with private trx parameter\n- Methods now use this.trx instead of passed parameter\n- Simpler method signatures without trx parameter\n\nThis makes the code cleaner and enforces transaction usage through instantiation.\nI see we are now removing the static but i like the static methods for convenience. They provide a convenient way to use the service without having to create a new instance every time.\nHere's a hybrid approach that gives you both static convenience methods and instance methods for transaction handling:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  AddressInsert,\n  AddressSelect,\n} from \"@/features/address/address.types.ts\";\nimport { db } from \"@/db/index.ts\";\nimport { address as addressSchema } from \"@/db/schema/index.ts\";\nimport { and, eq } from \"drizzle-orm\";\nimport { Transaction } from \"@/types/drizzle.type.ts\";\n\nexport class AddressService {\n  constructor(private trx: Transaction = db) {}\n\n  // Instance methods for transaction context\n  async create(input: AddressInsert) {\n    const [address] = await this.trx\n      .insert(addressSchema)\n      .values(input)\n      .returning();\n    return address;\n  }\n\n  async findExisting(input: AddressSelect) {\n    return await this.trx\n      .select()\n      .from(addressSchema)\n      .where(\n        and(\n          eq(addressSchema.country, input.country),\n          eq(addressSchema.city, input.city),\n          eq(addressSchema.zip, input.zip),\n        ),\n      )\n      .limit(1)\n      .then((rows) => rows[0] || null);\n  }\n\n  // Static convenience methods\n  static async create(input: AddressInsert) {\n    return new AddressService().create(input);\n  }\n\n  static async findExisting(input: AddressSelect) {\n    return new AddressService().findExisting(input);\n  }\n\n  // Static method to get instance with transaction\n  static withTransaction(trx: Transaction) {\n    return new AddressService(trx);\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage:\n// Static usage (without transaction):\nawait AddressService.create({ /* ... */ });\n\n// Transaction usage:\nawait db.transaction(async (trx) => {\n  const addressService = AddressService.withTransaction(trx);\n  await addressService.create({ /* ... */ });\n});\n```\n\nBenefits:\n- Static methods for quick one-off operations\n- Instance methods for transaction context\n- `withTransaction` static method for clean transaction handling\n- Maintains all the convenience while adding transaction support\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":469}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":92},"start":6982,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":470}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":101},"start":7002,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":471}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":186},"start":7099,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":472}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":237},"start":7118,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":473}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":238},"start":8653,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":474}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":420},"start":8838,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":475}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":421},"start":10788,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":476}}}],"summary":"Refactoring AddressService Transaction Handling","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1277,"end":5824},"icon":"Library","label":"deno-hono-zod-drizzle-supabase","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":5825,"end":6779},"icon":"File","label":"lokal-link-be/src/features/address/services/address.services.ts","metadata":{"path":"lokal-link-be/src/features/address/services/address.services.ts"}}]}
