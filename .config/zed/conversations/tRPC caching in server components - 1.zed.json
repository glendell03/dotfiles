So when both `StudioInfo` and `StudioClasses` call `api.studio.findUnique({ slug })` with the same parameter, the second call will use the cached result from the first call.\n\nThis is part of NextJS's built-in request memoization. You don't need to implement any caching logic yourself - it happens automatically within a single render pass of your page.\n\nIf you need to manually control this behavior, you can use React's Cache API or Next.js's unstable_cache API, but for your current usage pattern, the automatic deduplication is already working.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":48}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":42},"start":2147,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":49}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":43},"start":2831,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":50}}}],"summary":"tRPC caching in server components","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null}]}
