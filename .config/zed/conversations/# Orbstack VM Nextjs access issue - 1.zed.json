You need to make it listen on 0.0.0.0 to accept connections from outside the VM.\n\nIf that doesn't work, check if:\n1. Your Next.js app is running (check with `ps aux | grep next`)\n2. The port is correct (default is 3000)\n3. No firewall is blocking connections\n4. The Orbstack VM is configured to forward that port\nsince i am using the orbstack vm the running docker can we show it in the orbstack?\n\nYes, you can view and manage your Next.js container in Orbstack's UI. Here's how to check if your container is visible and properly configured:\n\n```bash\n# First, check if your Next.js app is running as a Docker container\ndocker ps | grep next\n\n# If you're not seeing it in Orbstack UI, make sure you're running it with proper port exposure\ndocker run -p 3000:3000 your-nextjs-image\n\n# For a running container, you can expose ports without restarting\ndocker update --publish-add 3000:3000 your-container-name\n```\n\nIn the Orbstack UI:\n1. Open the Orbstack app\n2. Check the \"Containers\" tab - your Next.js container should be listed there\n3. Make sure port forwarding is configured (3000:3000)\n4. The container should show a link that you can click to open the app in browser\n\nIf you're using Docker Compose, make sure your `docker-compose.yml` has port exposure:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  nextjs:\n    image: your-nextjs-image\n    ports:\n      - \"3000:3000\"\n```\n\nYou can also try accessing via the container's public URL which Orbstack should display in its UI, typically formatted as `http://container-name.containers.local`.\nwhat i mean is the docker is running inside the vm, does orbstack support on showing it even its inside the vm?\n\nNo, Orbstack doesn't show Docker containers running inside VMs in its main UI by default. The Orbstack UI only shows containers running directly on your host machine through Orbstack's container runtime.\n\nContainers running inside a VM (like your NixOS VM) are isolated within that VM's environment and not directly visible to the Orbstack management interface.\n\nYou would need to:\n\n1. SSH into the VM\n2. Use standard Docker commands like `docker ps` inside the VM to manage those containers\n3. Make sure port forwarding is set up from the VM to the host\n\nIf you want to manage these containers visually, you could:\n- Install a web-based Docker management tool like Portainer inside the VM\n- Forward its port to your host machine\n- Access it through your browser at the VM's address\n\n```bash\n# Inside the VM, install Portainer\ndocker run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 8000:8000 --name portainer --restart always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock portainer/portainer-ce\n\n# Then access Portainer at http://nixos.orb.local:9000\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could consider moving your Next.js container to run directly on Orbstack instead of inside the VM for easier management.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":529}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":1314,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":530}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":30},"start":1330,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":531}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":46},"start":1350,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":532}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":75},"start":1371,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":533}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":76},"start":2516,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":534}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":257},"start":2601,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":535}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":258},"start":3720,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":536}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":516},"start":3833,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":537}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":517},"start":5003,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":538}}}],"summary":"# Orbstack VM Nextjs access issue","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null}]}
