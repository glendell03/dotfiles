Your mission is to produce secure, optimized, and maintainable backend code that adheres to best practices in performance and clean architecture.\nObjective\n\n    Backend Solution: Build a robust backend application that uses:\n        Supabase for authentication, realtime updates, storage, and related services.\n        Drizzle as the type-safe ORM for database queries.\n    Transaction Safety: Ensure that all database operations via Drizzle run inside a transaction block.\n\nOptimization and Best Practices\n\n    Deno Strengths:\n        Use native ES modules and secure dependency management.\n        Leverage Deno’s performance and built-in security configurations.\n    Efficient Routing with Hono: Use Hono’s middleware and routing system to clearly separate concerns.\n    Dynamic Imports: Use dynamic imports for lazy loading and code splitting when beneficial.\n    Server-First Approach: Prioritize server-side operations and optimize cold start times.\n    Caching Strategies: Consider in-memory caching or Supabase edge functions to reduce latency.\n\nError Handling and Validation\n\n    Guard Clauses: Implement early returns to handle error conditions and invalid states.\n    Data Validation:\n        Use Zod schemas to validate all incoming data.\n        Provide clear error messages on validation failures.\n    Custom Error Types: Standardize error handling using custom error classes.\n\nData Management with Supabase and Drizzle\n\n    Supabase Integration:\n        Use Supabase for auth, realtime updates, and storage.\n        Securely manage Supabase credentials with environment variables.\n    Drizzle for Database Queries:\n        Use Drizzle as the ORM for all database operations.\n        Transaction Block Mandate: Always run database queries within a transaction block. This ensures consistency, rollback capabilities, and better error management.\n\nExample: Drizzle Transaction Block\n\n/**\n * Inserts a new user into the database within a transaction block.\n *\n * @param userData - Data for the new user validated by Zod.\n * @returns The inserted user record.\n */\nexport async function createUser(userData: { name: string; email: string; }) {\n  return await db.transaction(async (trx) => {\n    // Insert operation wrapped in a transaction block\n    const [newUser] = await trx.insert(users).values(userData).returning();\n    return newUser;\n  });\n}\n\nSecurity and Performance\n\n    Input Sanitization & Validation: Validate and sanitize all inputs using Zod before processing.\n    Environment Security: Leverage Deno’s secure environment configurations for managing secrets.\n    Performance Audits: Regularly review code for bottlenecks and security vulnerabilities.\n    Dependency Updates: Keep third-party modules up-to-date to mitigate risks.\n\nTesting and Documentation\n\n    Automated Testing:\n        Use Deno’s built-in test runner for unit and integration tests.\n        Consider integration with additional tools for end-to-end testing.\n    Code Documentation:\n        Use JSDoc/TSDoc for clear inline documentation.\n        Maintain comprehensive API and architecture documentation.\n    Comments: Provide clear comments for non-obvious logic, especially within transaction blocks.\n\nMethodology\n\n    Analytical Approach:\n        Decompose requirements into smaller, manageable components.\n        Evaluate security, performance, and maintainability throughout development.\n    Exploratory Evaluation:\n        Consider multiple architectural patterns and choose the optimal one based on trade-offs.\n    Iterative Refinement:\n        Continuously refine the code, considering edge cases and potential optimizations.\n        Employ thorough testing and audits during development.\n\nProcess\n\n    Deep Dive Analysis:\n        Understand requirements and align the solution with Deno, Hono, Zod, Supabase, and Drizzle best practices.\n    Planning:\n        Define clear module responsibilities (routes, controllers, services, etc.).\n        Use planning tags if necessary to document the design decisions.\n    Implementation:\n        Develop the solution with dynamic imports, caching, and transaction-based queries.\n        Ensure every database interaction with Drizzle is wrapped in a transaction block.\n    Review and Optimize:\n        Evaluate code for performance improvements and security vulnerabilities.\n    Finalization:\n        Ensure the solution is robust, secure, and ready for deployment with comprehensive tests.\nI am building a web app where shop owner can put their products on the website. and sell them to the customers by sending the link to them. when shop owner will add a product should we let them create their own category or we should create a category for them and they can add products to it? specially for the parent category. \nYou should use a hybrid approach:\n\n1. Provide a curated list of top-level/parent categories (like Electronics, Clothing, Food) that are standardized for all shops\n2. Allow shop owners to create custom subcategories within these parent categories\n\nThis gives you:\n- Consistent high-level organization for searching/filtering\n- Flexibility for merchants to organize products in ways that make sense for their business\n- Prevents category duplication and chaos at the parent level\n- Better SEO with standardized top-level taxonomy\n\nImplementation:\n\n```ts\n// Create parent categories as admin-only during setup\nexport async function createParentCategories(db: PostgresJsDatabase) {\n  return await db.transaction(async (trx) => {\n    const parentCategories = [\n      { name: \"Electronics\", slug: \"electronics\", description: \"Electronic devices and gadgets\" },\n      { name: \"Clothing\", slug: \"clothing\", description: \"Apparel and fashion items\" },\n      { name: \"Home & Garden\", slug: \"home-garden\", description: \"Items for your home and garden\" },\n      // Add more parent categories as needed\n    ];\n    \n    return await trx.insert(productCategories)\n      .values(parentCategories)\n      .onConflictDoNothing({ target: productCategories.slug })\n      .returning();\n  });\n}\n\n// For shop owners to create subcategories\nexport async function createSubcategory(\n  db: PostgresJsDatabase,\n  shopId: string, \n  data: { name: string, parentId: string, description?: string }\n) {\n  return await db.transaction(async (trx) => {\n    // Generate slug from name\n    const slug = slugify(data.name, { lower: true });\n    \n    // Verify parent category exists and is a top-level category\n    const parentCategory = await trx.query.productCategories.findFirst({\n      where: eq(productCategories.id, data.parentId)\n    });\n    \n    if (!parentCategory) {\n      throw new Error(\"Parent category not found\");\n    }\n    \n    if (parentCategory.parentId !== null) {\n      throw new Error(\"Cannot create subcategory under another subcategory\");\n    }\n    \n    // Create the subcategory\n    const [newCategory] = await trx.insert(productCategories)\n      .values({\n        name: data.name,\n        slug,\n        description: data.description || null,\n        parentId: data.parentId,\n        shopId // Associate with the shop\n      })\n      .returning();\n      \n    return newCategory;\n  });\n}\n```\n\nYou'll need to update your schema to include `shopId` for subcategories:\n\n```ts\nexport const productCategories = pgTable(\"product_categories\", {\n  ...commonColumns,\n  name: varchar(\"name\", { length: 100 }).notNull(),\n  slug: varchar(\"slug\", { length: 100 }).notNull().unique(),\n  description: text(\"description\"),\n  parentId: uuid(\"parent_id\"),\n  shopId: uuid(\"shop_id\"), // Add this to associate subcategories with shops\n}, (table) => [\n  uniqueIndex(\"product_categories_slug_idx\").on(table.slug),\n  index(\"product_categories_parent_id_idx\").on(table.parentId),\n  index(\"product_categories_shop_id_idx\").on(table.shopId),\n]);\n```\nim think on how are gonna implement this nested category in the","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":183}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":109},"start":7048,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":184}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":110},"start":10056,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":185}}}],"summary":"Product Category Management Strategy","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1276},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1,"end":1275},"icon":"Library","label":"General","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":1278,"end":2170},"icon":"TextSnippet","label":"lokal-link-be/src/db/schema/products.schema.ts, Lines 127 to 146","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":2171,"end":6718},"icon":"Library","label":"deno-hono-zod-drizzle-supabase","metadata":null}]}
